# 1. Interesting Concept
I like that you decided to make your page about the impact of CS as a whole on different parts of our world. I think that is a quite smart idea and I don't think any other
group has done that.


# 2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation
The visuals are quite consistent (other that Social Domain, which uses a different color scheme). But I must admit I don't like it. The text is too big and 
therefore hard to read and the green is just ugly (sorry).

# 3. Quality of written presentation
There is a lot of text and like I said before it's hard to read due to the styling. So I didn't read it...

# 4. Validity of HTML
I don't see any big problems with HTML

# 5. Evidence of collaboration
It looks like the work was split pretty evenly. I cannot really comment on time of completation, because I don't know. Commits don't really show the whole picture.
